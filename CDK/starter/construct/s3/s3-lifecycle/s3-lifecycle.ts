/*
The transition to INTELLIGENT_TIERING must come at least 30 days after
the transition to INFREQUENT_ACCESS, if both are set.

The transition to GLACIER must come at least 30 days after the transition to INTELLIGENT_TIERING.

The transition to DEEP_ARCHIVE must come at least 90 days after the transition to GLACIER.
That's because, if we store data in Glacier for less than 90 days, we end up paying for the whole 90 days.
